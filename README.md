# Dice 
This program is a tutorial on how to use TDD effectively in creating a program, 
I used both feature testing and unit testing throughout creating my program. 

The program is a basic Dice game which allows the user to roll a number of dices, 
and get an output of all the dices which can be used in various board games.
